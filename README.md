# PyBer Challenge

## Analysis 

In todays analysis I am creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I am also figuring out how data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. I am creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
- Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.

## Summary

To summerize todays report Urban areas have the most traffic based on drivers and rides, keeping the fare down per ride which also affects how much the driver makes. At the same time in Rural areas the average cost per ride is much higher, giving more money back to the drivers. My recommendation for Pyber are to increase the amount of drivers in rural areas to make sure there are enough drivers. The data can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
